Please analyze this Flutter file (PracticeMistakesScreen) and refactor it into proper clean architecture:

1. First, analyze the code and identify:
   - UI components (widgets, screens)
   - Business logic (the state management, transformations)
   - Data handling (where data comes from and how it's processed)

2. Create a refactoring plan with:
   - A proper folder structure following clean architecture principles
   - Separation into domain, data, and presentation layers
   - Identification of entities, use cases, and repositories needed

3. Implement the refactoring by:
   - Creating domain entities (Mistake, MistakeDetail, etc.)
   - Defining repository interfaces in the domain layer
   - Creating use cases for each core function (e.g., GetPracticeMistake, RecordAttempt)
   - Implementing repository in the data layer
   - Separating the UI into reusable widgets
   - Implementing proper state management with BLoC pattern
   - Maintaining theme support with the existing ThemeProvider

4. Ensure the refactored code:
   - Maintains all existing functionality
   - Follows the dependency rule (dependencies point inward)
   - Has clear separation of concerns
   - Is testable at each layer

After analyzing, please start by creating the folder structure, then implement each layer systematically, explaining your decisions.
